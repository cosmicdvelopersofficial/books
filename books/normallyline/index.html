<h1>What is the line of normallity? (Fictional) </h1>
<p>What if, there was a scale that described how "normal" a person is? It could have some levels letting us know the mental state of <br>
the human. If this scale was made, it would have the following scales: <br>
N1, N2, W1, W2, W3, MI1,MI2,MI3 <br>
N1: This could represent the most normal and <b>formal</b> percentage of the world. 
<br>
N2: This is the majority of people. 
<br>
W1: The people that can be kinda weird but people around them do not mind.
<br>
W2, W3: The people that are just very wierd and get avoided by people around them
<br>
MI1: Could possibly suffer from a mental ilness. Therapist help advised. 
<br>
MI2, MI3: Propably suffers from a mental ilness. Help required.
<br>
<br>
The scale could look like this in plain computer text: 
<br>
<br>
N1-----N2--------W1-----------W2-------------W3--MI1----MI2----------MI3
<br>
<br>
It is thought that people could Move towards the paranormal parts of the scale (W2+) because: <br>
1. of their high ego <br>
2. the lack of friends (loneliness) <br>
<br>
Also, people that are very selfish and could harm anyone so they can feel right and superior, deserve a place between <br>
the MI1 and MI2 part of the scale. 
<br>
It is worth mentioning that lonely people have more chances of being at a W1,2 or 3 place of the line. Since they are lonely, <br>
they must be avoided by their surrounded people. 
<br>
Lastly, people who could leave permanent damage to someone to to their violence, for not a very important reason could be considered <br>
as a menace to soceity resulting to a MI3 personality.
