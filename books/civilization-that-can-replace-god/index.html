<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:107%'>Is there a civilization that can
replace God?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As we know, we are most likely not alone in
space. There are <span lang=EL>Ω</span> civilizations in space. <span lang=EL>Ω</span><span
lang=EL> </span>civilizations get created/per change happening in a universe.
Not only are we full of other civilizations, but we are probably not very
advanced in terms of technology, intelligence and energy. Humans have not
travelled to another planet. The furthest is the moon. We are rated as a Type
0.7 civilization in the Kardashev Scale. We are not in the top, since it goes
up to at least Type 7. Today we will be focusing on the 7<sup>th</sup> Type. Can
the 7<sup>th</sup> type be the one that started everything? And most importantly,
why did they create us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 Starting with the abilities of the 7<sup>th</sup>
type, they can control a part of the multiverse. Meaning that, they can create,
edit, and delete universes. Time travelling in the 7<sup>th</sup> type could be
done by creating a universe as mentioned in my previous theory. So, even if Earth
was created by the 7<sup>th</sup> type, or to be more accurate, even if <span
lang=EL>Ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>Earths were created by the 7<sup>th</sup>
type, they could be all altered. So, if the 7<sup>th</sup> type is not God, they
can emulate the powers and abilities to become one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                So, the 7<sup>th</sup> type could be named
“God”, but why did they create us? If our universe is one of the <span lang=EL>Ω</span><span
lang=EL> </span>universes made per choice, then they probably won’t harm us and
the role of the ‘God of Our Universe” is nonexistent. But if they created us, they
might manipulate us towards their and their friend’s benefit. For example,
humans have noticed some strange effects. People have sworn they have seen items
that never existed. This is called “The Mandella Effect”. Let me give you an
example: The “Monopoly Man” always wears a monocle? Well, there was never a
version of the Monopoly Man with a monocle. The 7th type might have edited it
for their benefit.</p>
